# Hi there <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1303154/88677602-1635ba80-d120-11ea-84d8-d263ba5fc3c0.gif" width="28px" alt="hi">,
## My name is Mohamed Ali ZNIDI

Iâ€™m a Full-Stack Engineer who builds AI-native SaaS dashboards and scalable front-end systems. My work sits at the junction of product UX, design systems, and agentic AI â€” I ship modular apps (Next.js + TypeScript) that include conversational and automation assistants to improve user workflows. Previously I helped maintain and modernize enterprise Angular apps (Fitnet, IGA), established internal design system docs, and taught UX fundamentals at GoMyCode.

Since March 2025 Iâ€™ve been freelancing and competing in hackathons â€” leading a parking management platform built with Next.js and prototyping AI chatbots for the insurance sector. Iâ€™m targeting roles in AI tooling, dashboarding, and design-system engineering. Open to hybrid or relocation opportunities.
